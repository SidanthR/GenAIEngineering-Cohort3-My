#WorkBook

# Python File Handling Practice Exercises
# Level 1 ‚Äì Basics

# Create a file

# Write a Python program to create a file called myfile.txt.

# Inside it, write the text:

# Hello Python!
# I‚Äôm learning file handling.


# Read the whole file

# Open myfile.txt in read mode.

# Print all its content at once.

# Read line by line

# Open the same file.

# Print each line separately (remove the \n at the end).

# Append text

# Add this line at the end of myfile.txt:

# This line was appended later.


# Check file exists

# Use Python to check if myfile.txt exists before opening it.

# If it doesn‚Äôt exist, print: "File not found!".

# Level 2 ‚Äì Intermediate

# Count lines in a file

# Count how many lines are in myfile.txt.

# Print: "This file has X lines."

# Save user input to file

# Ask the user to type 3 sentences.

# Save them into a file called diary.txt.

# Read file into a list

# Open diary.txt.

# Store each line in a list and print the list.

# Copy content from one file to another

# Read all content from myfile.txt.

# Write it into a new file copy.txt.

# Word counter

# Read myfile.txt.

# Count how many words it contains.

# Print the number.

# Level 3 ‚Äì Small Project

# üìÇ Mini Diary App

# Create a Python program called diary.py.

# Features:

# Each time the program runs, ask the user: "Write your diary entry:".

# Save the entry into diary.txt with today‚Äôs date.

# Then ask: "Do you want to read all past entries? (yes/no)".

# If yes, print the whole diary.
